Welcome to Djask
=================================

Djask is full-featured Python Web framework based on the famous project `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/>`_.
It aims to be as extensible as Flask, as powerful as Django. It features a pluggable admin interface just like Django. Also based on `Grey Li <https://greyli.com>`_'s project `APIFlask <https://apiflask.com>`_,
Djask comes with a full support of Web APIs.

Currently, Djask supports SQLAlchemy only and more ORMs are going to be supported.
